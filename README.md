## Hi there, I'm Tejas!


ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on integrating GenAI with RAG. All things AI, all the time!

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the ins and outs of RAG, CAG, and Agentic RAGâ€”just diving deeper into the world of intelligent retrieval systems!

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on cool RAG projects that push the boundaries of AI! Let's make some magic happen.

âš¡ Fun fact: I can code while listening to the weirdest music playlists! If you think you can top my list, send me your best one.
